	FOR TESTING PURPOSES CREATE A QUICK 'n DIRTY GRID TO TEST WITH SO THAT 
	YOU DONT HAVE TO READ IN THE GRID FROM A FILE IN ORDER TO GET SOMETHING WORKING
	THIS APPROACH WILL GERENRATE AND PRINT EVERY POSSIBLE STRING FROM THE GRID

   MAIN()
   {
   	String[][] board = { {"a","b"}, {"c,"d"} };  // 2 X 2
	-or-
	   String[][] board = { { "a","b","c" }, { "d","e","f" }, { "g","h","i"} };  // 3 X 3
	-or-
	   String[][] board = { { "a","b","c","d" }, { "e","f","g","h" }, 
        	                { "i","j","k", "l"}, { "m","n","o","p" } };  // 4 X 4

	for r=0 to < board.length
		for c = 0 to board[r].length
			dfs( r,c,board,"");
   }
   private static void  dfs(int r, int c, int[][] board, String word )
   {	
	APPEND letter at [r][c] to WORD

	PRINT THE WORD (or add it to an ArrayList to sort then print at end ofprogram)

	IF N (or S or SE or E etc) IS A LOWER CASE LETTER
		MAKE [r][c] UPPERCASE // mark it as IN USE in this string
		RECURSE PASSING IN COORDS OF N (or S or SE or E etc ), BOARD AND WORD
		MAKE [r][c] LOWERCASE // un mark it as NOT in use in this string
	
		
   }
