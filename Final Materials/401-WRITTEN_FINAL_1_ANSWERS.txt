Section 1:  TRUE / FALSE  1 pt each

1)  FALSE When you extend a class you are required to write a constructor.
	
2)  TRUE  By using the keyword super you can invoke a method that resides in your parent's class

3)  TRUE  Implementing and interface and extending an abstract class both require you to write at least one method.

4)  FALSE  You can extend multiple classes - i.e. your new class can have multiple immediate parents

5)  TRUE   You can implement multiple interfaces.

6)  FALSE  You can declare all your constuctors as private.

7)  FALSE  Polymorhism means wherever a reference (non primitive) type is expected I can use an object of the same type or its parent type.

8)  FALSE  Polymorphism means anywhere any primitive is expected I can use any object type and it will autobox in or out automatically and convert between any type to any type.

9)  FALSE  Autoboxing means anywhere any primitive is expected I can use any object type and it will autobox in or out automatically and convert between any type to any type.

10) TRUE   All classes have Object (capital "O") type as thier ancestor.

11) TRUE   The search operation on a HashMap is faster than a search into an unsorted array. 

12) TRUE   The search operation on a HashMap is faster than a search into an sorted array. 

13) TRUE   The search for an element in a HashSet is faster that a search on a sorted array.

14) TRUE   The Number classes (Integer, Float, Byte etc) wrap up a primitive value inside the object. 

15) TRUE   When you pass a reference variable into a method, you cannot change the actual value inside that ref var because you were just passing a copy of the value.
 

Section 2: Free response 2 pts each   


1) What is the difference betwen deep and shallow copy?
	SHALLOW COPIEs THE REFERENCE DEEP COPIEs THe DATA

2) What benefits does inheritence bring to a Java programmer programmer?
	CODE REUSE Or ANY OTHER CORRECt ANSWER

3) Why should the data members of a class be private instead of public?
	SO CLIENTS Of THE CLASS CANNOT DIRECTLY MODIFY DATA VIA = OPERATOR

4) Name one difference between a checked and an unchecked exception.
	CHECKED REQUIRES TRY CATCH OR THROWS CLAUSE 
	ANY OTHEr CORRECt ANSWER ACEPTED

5) Describe one way that an interface differs from an abstract class.
	INTERFACE Is IMLIMENTED, ABSTRACT CLASS EXTENDED

6) Name a Java class (class, not interface) that is good for representing members of a group and doing matematical operations such as membership, intersection or union.
	HASHSET

7) Name one difference between a HashSet and a HashMap.
	Hash Set does not have values mapped to the keys
	ANY CORRECt ANSWER ACEPTABLE

8) Name one property/attribute/functionality that HashMap and Hash set do not support.
	NO ORDERING, NO SORTING, DOES NOT PRESERVE GUARANTEE ORDER OF RETRIEVAL UPON ITERATION

9) Why MUST hashSet and HashMap implement the equals/equality relation property?
	OTHERWISE TEST FOR MEMBERSHIP COULD NOT BE DONE AND UNIQUENESS IMPOSSIBLE TO ENFORCE

10) Name one property about the keys in a hashmap that must be true.
	UNIQUENESS i.e NO DUPES


SHORT ANSWER QUESTIONS

11)	Suppose you are implementing an interface and you are writing one of the methods that is required by that interface. 
Further assume you have a line of code in that required method that could throw a checked exception - i.e. you are opening a file.  
In order to appease the compiler requirement that you do something about checked exceptions - what could you do to make it compile and run correctly?

b)  wrap the code that opens the file in a try/catch block

12) 	If I wanted to store every word in the English language along with its unique primary definition, and then  
be able to look up a word's definition if given the word to look up. Furthermore I would like be able to print out  
that dictionary in a sorted list of words with each word's definition on the same line as the word. 
CIRCLE the optimal container.
                                                                
(f) TreeMap	allow storage of pairs and preserves sorting order

13) You are the senior software architect for the new one world govt. (1WG) in 2038. 
This 1WG has implanted a scanable chip into the body of every human. 
Every building or area that a human passes into/out-of has a scanner placed and an armed 1WG-Police monitoring the scanner. 
The scanner reads the chip's unique ID code and looks it up on the NSA's 1WGserver. 
Once the ID is confirmed as an existing ID, it is used to retrieve a value associated with every ID. 
That value represents what action (if any) should be taken against person who is being scanned (ignore,  arrest, shoot on sight, obliterate with a drone strike, etc.). 
There are about 8 billion humans being scanned repeatedly all day long.
 In order to minimize response time since the 1WG-PD officer may only have seconds to execute the action prescribed by the 1WGserver. 

CIRCLE the optimal container.

(d) HashMap	allow storage of pairs and is the fastest for huge data 


14)	Assume you have two classes written as follows. Both are in separate files named Parent.java and Child.java  respectively. 
	public class Parent
	{
		private int x;
		public Parent( int x )
		{
			this.x = x;
		}
	}
	public class Child extends Parent
	{
		public int y;
		public Child( int y )
		{
			this.y = y;
		}
	}
	
	In  a file named Tester.java you have this main method
	public static void main( String args[] )
	{
		Child c = new Child();
		c.y = 25;
		System.out.println( c.y );
	}
	
	What will be the outcome of this Tester program?  Circle your answer and fill in the "because:"
	(You get NO credit for circling the right answer if your explanation is not correct)

	a) It will not compile because:  Child does not have a default C'tor
